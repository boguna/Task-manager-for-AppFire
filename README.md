The task manager application that contains a form in which there is one input for title of the task and one
text area for description of the task you wish to add. Once this is done click the button Add task and the
task should be added in the below in the unfinished task list.
From now on you have three options for each and every task that has being created:
1. The “complete” button which upon pressing will move the task into the finished tasks list. If you
wish to go, there you simply click the filter tasks’ options and choose finished task where your
completed task should now be.
2. The “edit” button which upon pressing will bring a pop-up window containing input for you to
edit first the title and second the description. Those changes will be saved upon clicking the save
button.
3. The “delete” button which upon pressing will delete the task.
The last functionality is the “export” button which upon pressing will export as the name suggest a csv
file containing all tasks that you have created. The file will start downloading as soon as the button is
pressed.
NOTE the application is using local storage, which means that the tasks will be saved upon reloading and
reopening the application.
